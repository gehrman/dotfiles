;;; config-misc --- Miscellaneous setup.

;;; Commentary:
;; This file is for (package) configuration that don't really fit elsewhere.
;; More general/minimal necessary configuration should go in init.el, but
;; clearly there's still some overlap between the two.

;;; Code:
(require 'pianobar)
(setq pianobar-username "gehrman@gmail.com")

(provide 'config-misc)
;;; config-misc.el ends here
